This is a CakePHP wrapper for [the HTML Purifier lib](http://htmlpurifier.org/).

HTML Purifier is a standards-compliant HTML filter library written in PHP. HTML Purifier will not only remove all malicious code (better known as XSS) with a thoroughly audited, secure yet permissive whitelist, it will also make sure your documents are standards compliant, something only achievable with a comprehensive knowledge of W3C's specifications.

The plugin includes a trait, a view helper, a behavior and a shell to clean your markup wherever you like, in the view or in the model layer or clean any table and field using the shell.
